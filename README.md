# carry-out

I'm a self-requestable self-hosted [React.js](https://reactjs.org) component! Try connecting me to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

```bash
vercel
```

Then press `y`, choose a scope, press `n`, enter a component name, press the enter key, press `n`. I should now be deployed on Vercel at some URL!
